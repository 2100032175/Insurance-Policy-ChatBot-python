This insurance chatbot acts like your personal policy helper. You upload your insurance documents, then ask questions in everyday language like 'Does my plan cover dental?' or 'What's the claim process for a car accident?'. It reads through your policies and gives clear answers instantly, saving you from digging through confusing paperwork. The best part? Everything stays private on your computer - no sharing sensitive data with outside companies. It's not perfect (sometimes says 'I'm not sure' if the answer isn't in your documents), but it's way faster than calling customer service. Think of it like having a helpful insurance expert available 24/7 in your web browser.

How it works (upload docs + ask questions)
Real examples of questions
Benefits (saves time, keeps data private)
Honest about limitations
